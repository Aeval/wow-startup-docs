# About

This documentation is a living document aimed at providing new players (or fuzzy returning players) with a guide on how to configure and enjoy the UI in WoW.

> This will focus on the native UI but I will include a section on ElvUI later.

# General Notes

Just a reminder that this is what works for me.

Take it as a guideline and update your preferences as you get used to your class and build. We all have different set ups but this will serve as a springboard.

# The UI

> A quick breakdown of the standard UI by section and function

## Action Bar (AB)

![The Action Bar](/_media/action-bar.png)

> The action bar is where your spells and abilities are held.

By default there are 6 action bars available to you in your main bar. You can sort through them with the yellow arrows to the right of the bar.

Any spells from your spellbook can be placed here, as well as anything else castable such as:

- Abilities
- Mounts
- Consumables
- Castable Items (Hearthstones)
- Ect...

Everything on the castbar can be mapped to keybindings for easy access, though you only have access to the key bindings on the currently visible AB.

## Panels Bar

![The Panels Bar](/_media/panels-bar.png)

> This is where you access the most important interface panels, in case you forget the keybinds (like I do). I also don't know what this is actually called, so Panels Bar it is.

If you hover these buttons, it'll show you the keybinds set for them as well.

## The Minimap

![The Minimap](/_media/minimap.png)

> Obviously I don't need to explain this shit, but what might help to know is how the magnifying glass icon on the left side works.

![The Magnifying Glass](/_media/tracking.png)

If you click the magnifying glass, you get a small dropdown that lets you select or deselect things you want to actually show up on your minimap, from gathering materials to bankers and more.

# General Set-up

> Here I'll go over some settings I enjoy having on all my toons that are standard in WoW.

IMPORTANT: ALWAYS HIT 'OKAY' WHEN MAKING CHANGES IN THE MENU! DO NOT HIT ESC OR CANCEL TO EXIT OR ALL CHANGES MADE WILL BE LOST.

## ESC -> Interface

### Controls

![Controls](/_media/interface-controls.png)

Most notably, **Auto Loot** should be turned on. This makes it so that everything gets picked up automatically when you loot a dead thing. No more clicking every item.

### Social

> Not going to provide a screenshot here as I'd only recommend one thing: Check the box next to "Block Guild Invites". Until we have our own and you are in one, these invites are constant and annoying.

### ActionBars

> Now the important one

![ActionBars](/_media/actionbars.png)

Generally, I would strongly recommend checking the first 4 boxes, as that will display more ActionBars on your screen for you to utilize.

Doing so will grant you a longer standard bar, as well as two bars over it and two bars to the right side of your screen. This is valuable spell and ability room.

They can all be bound to keys, making it very customizable and helpful.

![Rightbars](/_media/rightbars.png)
![Extrabars](/_media/extrabars.png)

### Names

![Names](/_media/names.png)

> Most of this can be left as default but there is a helpful option if you want it:

Checking "Personal Resource Display" will show your health and mana/resource beneath your character model. This makes for more convenient reference as you don't have to look up at your nameplate all the time.

You can also show your special resources over your current target if you'd like, but you can play around with that.

## ESC -> Key Bindings (RECOMMENDED)

> Now to the real reason I made this shit

### Movement Keys

![Movement Keys](/_media/movementkeys.png)

By default, the WASD keys are set to:

`W`: Forward
`S`: Back
`A`: Turn Left
`D`: Turn Right

`Q`/`E`: Strafe Left/Right respectively

I **HIGHLY** suggest rebinding:

`A`: Strafe Left
`D`: Strafe Right

There's not a whole lot of _turning_ in WoW. If you need to turn, you'll usually do so with your mouse and right click. You don't really need buttons assigned for turning, but if you MUST have them, I suggest the arrow keys, cause that's how little you use them.

You need to face a target to cast at it, and turning kinda fucks that up.

### Action Bar

> Here's where the fun begins

I recommend a keybind set-up like this:

![Key Binds](/_media/keybind1.png)

As you can see, we needed the `Q` and `A` for spells instead of strafing.

I set them up this way so that I have quick access in difficult content. Our hand is already used to always being on `W` `A` `S` & `D` that it is only logical to move it as little as possible in fights.

So our most important/most used spells go on `Q` and `E`, followed by `R` and `F`, which we can reach easily with our index finger.

From there, I put spells that are important, but have long cooldowns (these are often just called your classes 'Cooldowns') on `1` `2` `3` & `4` since they are relatively easy to hit from the resting position as well.

### MultiActionBar

> Following down the rabbit hole

I recommend extending these practices like so:

![Extra Key Binds](/_media/keybind2.png)

Following the logic from the [Action Bar](/#action-bar) section, I just add key 'modifiers' to those keybinds.

So `Shift + Q` is usually the 3rd most cast spell in my kit, `Shift + E` the 4th most important, and so on.

Then since it's more difficult for me to wrap my brain around hitting it and since my thumb gets tired of searching for it, I place important but situational abilities on `CTRL + Q`, `CTRL + E` and so on.

All of this so you don't have to worry about stretching across to hit `9` in the middle of a Raid.

### Quick Keybind Mode

> This is useful to bind these keys to places that make the most visual sense it you. As long as you can see the Action Bars on the screen you can use their keybinds. So assign them wherever you'd like on your UI.

For example:

![Extra Key Binds](/_media/quickmode.png)

Click one of the glowing boxes and then enter a key for it like `Q` or `CTRL + Q` and it will bind it there for you. Now regardless of which box on your screen it was, you'll access it by hitting that key.

You can use this to arrange your spell however you best remember your rotation.

### Unbound Spaces

Having some spaces in the right Action Bar or the bottom-right side of the bottom Action Bar can be handy, as you can put things there you would only use rarely and wouldn't want to waste a keybind on like:

- Consumables
- Mounts
- Items
- Etc.

# Macros

We'll get to this shit later, as they are very useful but also up to personal preference.
